### Chris Johnson

+ PhD program at UT and worked my way through CS on my own.

+ spent almost 3 years studying CS in my free time before I applied for a single job.
+ Question:
  + What does quality assurance do
  + How did you find the job at school? How to find jobs apart from those big companies and those who list on linked-in ? 
  + What's your suggestion on interacting with smaller companies?
  + I am feeling anxious for job application now because I only had one year of experience and most of which is not in SDE
  + Right now I am working on leetcode, personal project, and courses, what will be most important in finding a job?
