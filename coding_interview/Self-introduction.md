I was trained a chemist, but I dropped out from my PhD study at Caltech because of chronic pain and depression. During that period, the only part of research that was enjoyable for me was writing code, so I entered the computer science master program at UT Austin. Suddenly everything became so exciting for me. I spent quite a while exploring different topics, and realized that among all these exciting fields, I am happiest when studying front end. It is purely satisfying to see code becomes beautiful visuals, and to imaging users actually using the product. So I started to build a web application for chronic pain patients as a learning process, and here I am seeking to learn more and maybe contribute to an app like trello that I was once a user of.
