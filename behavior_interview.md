### Why do you apply to this position

+ I am passionate about front end development. Among all parts of software engineering, I am happiest when studying front end. It is purely satisfying to see code becomes beautiful visuals, and to imaging how users feels using the product. (Tuning the UI is like meditation for me, and my brain just can't stop thinking how to improve user experiences from details of the code.)
+ I apply for Atlassian because team and project management is a big part of my interest.  Although I haven't had chance to use DevOps methodologies, I love exploring different ways to manage teams during my previous leadership experiences.  I also love how lively and open Atlassian's culture is. It looks like an ideal place to learn from others, build friendships, come up with creative ideas and actually realize them.
+ I believe with my motivation and previous experience, I'd be able to quickly catch up with the projects and start contributing.

### What you want to achieve in this position

+ This will be my first internship. So my major goal is to learn about industrial projects as much as I can to make real progress in products customers actually use.
+ To achieve this I will first talk to colleagues from different departments to learn the overall organization of the projects,  major shortcomings and challenges. In the mean time learn more about the tech stacks used by the team using online tutorials. I would be happy to do this before the internship starts if that's allowed because of how short the internship is.
+ I will then work closely with my team to narrow down the focus and start solving technical problems, and hopefully deliver features that I can be proud of.

### What's your career goal

+ My career goal is to build product people really need and enjoy using. User experience is core the core motivation for me to start working on software development. No matter what kind of company and what role I may be working in in the future, the only thing I care is whether the product I am working on solves people's problems and brings them happiness. The product and customer focus of Atlassian is also a reason why I like this company.





### Most challenging project

+ Non-software: my research project when I was a PhD candidate at Caltech
  + Describe situation: 
    + This project was about optoelectronic properties of 2D materials. It involved three groups across US, four major contributors, and many other people who are not core to the project. We managed to carryout intricate studies on environment and time sensitive materials with a remote collaboration.
  + Actions: what happened
    + I was the first author who initiated and managed the progress throughout the project. I did most of the fabrication and testing, my collaborators at Los Alamos National Lab provided instruments and helped me with testing which generated the major results during my time there. We also had a group who did computations and we collaborated entirely remotely. 
  + Result:
    + We managed to publish in a major journal and the paper has been cited more than 20 times now.
  + Lesson learned
    + The major challenge apart from the scientific uncertainties was team communication. We collaborated remotely and may team members were so busy that it was hard to reach them when needed. In the end I developed different strategies to reach different people, and have small, one-on-one meetings rather than team-wise meeting to create more efficient communication. There was really no simple solution here because in such projects people are not expected to follow some single strict rules when it comes to communication.
+ Software:  
  + Situation: 
    + I am developing a tele-medicine web application for chronic pain patients. It is challenging because it is not a pre-designed course project and I am learning everything from scratch on my own. I do not have an official team or mentor to ask for help when needed
    + Although it is not group project, I managed to get people excited and help me with design and implementation challenges when I get stuck.
  + Actions: what happened
    + I did most of the design and implementation, and my friend in boston helped me to debug some code over several weekends. I also found friend from google and facebook that helped me to refine software design, and I really benefited from their inputs with industry experiences. They even asked me to create a startup for this project.
  + Result:
    + The website has a mostly functioning front end prototype right now, and we are still working on adding a back end and improving its capability for scaling.
  + Lesson learned
    + Although I was good at learning from online resources, I found it really helps to ask for help, no matter what stage the project is in. I was initially hesitated about asking for help because it is a personal project, but to my surprise people are really excited about such project, and are willing to spend hours and days helping me with details. 

### Example of solving conflict

+ Collaborating with UI designer. I was so excited and keep coming up with new ideas and asking him to test. The designer was frustrated and became impatient during the session.  I noticed this and had a discussion with him after the session, purely to talk about our experience on the session and how we can improve the communication. He was pretty open and said that the problem was not too many ideas, but me not describing my ideas clearly. He even gave me some examples on how to be more specific, such as I should say move the bottom box up by five pixels rather than saying "move that thing up a little bit". I found it really helpful and we are both confident to have smoother communications in the future sessions.

### Values

#### Advocate to push for change

+ What did you learn from this process, what was the outcome. -- Entrepreneureship club. Bring a student team to organize the FLOW competition.

#### Team work

+ How have you helped make a team/ individual more successful if they weren't performing where. Have you put the team's goals above personal ambitions?
+ Working on the color education app. I was quite ambitious about the app, with functionalities including color matching, class-room communication, color palettes, color book/ drawing game etc. We only had one month and I asked my partner for his input and he thought the scope is too large. So we distilled the functionalities down to only color exercises. Goal is to produce a smooth functioning app. 



#### Customer focus

+ What trade-offs did you make to put customer first -- Designing poster for a boba tea shop. Gave them the resources and let them explore the options. 



#### Open communication

+ What's your approach when having difficult conversations. Conflict. How you have adapted your communication style. -- communication with designer. 

#### Prioritisation and decision making

+ Examples when the team have missed the mark. How did you react. How did you approach fixing things? 
+ Life is all about problem solving. I don't see them as failure but just normal daily process. Second part of my research. The process is famous for its unpredictability, no/ little progress for months. If one path doesn't work, we need to find other directions. Look for more collaborations.
