### Telemedicine Software Features for Patients

The features of the patient app can include:

- **Registration** - a patient can sign up via mobile number, social network, or email. Since the app deals with sensitive data, it requires a higher level of protection. The recommendation is to use two-factor authentication, which can include SMS, voice, and phone verification.

- **Patient profile** - a patient needs to enter necessary healthcare records and compulsory information. Make this procedure as quick and easy as possible. Nobody wants to fill out long forms.

- **Search** - a patient can search for a medical specialist based on one or more criteria (specialization, proximity, doctor rating, etc.). For the first app version, the general advice is to limit search entities.

- **Appointments and calendar** - patient needs to have a list of appointments based on doctor availability, as well as the possibility to edit or cancel them.

- **Communication** - the process can be done via audio or video conferencing for real-time consultation. For the first version in telemedicine app development, it is wise to implement the simplest format (e.g. photo-based consultation for dermatologists).

- **Geolocation** - the patient should connect with practitioners with a valid license in a particular US state. The app should gather their location with the help of Google Maps or similar services.

- **Payment** - telemedicine app monetization can be done via integrating a payment gateway system (e.g. Stripe, Braintree, PayPal). The patient should also be able to view their transaction history.

- **Notifications** - push notifications and relevant reminders help to keep track of appointments.

- **Rating and review** - this is a must-have feature in case there is a doctor-patient aggregator. This function ensures proper service quality based on the collected feedback.

- Telemedicine app development for patients should take into account user experience and relevance of functionality. The patient app can also include some extra features like:

  - **Personalized dashboard** - complex feature, but useful to observe treatment progress or something similar.
  - **Medication tracking** - the app can remind a patient to take necessary medications and obtain refills.
  - **Secure chats** - the one-to-one messenger is a great communication channel between a doctor and a patient. This feature is easy to implement and can be included in the first app version. Note that a more advanced messenger with a multi-user chat system is harder to develop; it takes a substantial amount of effort and time, especially in the healthcare field. For instance, the Signal messaging app utilizes end-to-end encrypted messaging protocols (Curve25519, AES-256, and, HMAC-SHA256) to protect communication and ensure that no MITM (man-in-the-middle) attacks can occur.
  - **In-app calls** - the app can include emergency calls.
  - **Navigation** - it is possible to add the route to the hospital with additional information about the institution.
  - **Cloud data storage** - possibility to keep and manage EHRs. Other options are to view attached images & documents (lab results, X-rays, etc.). Also, the feature can help to export or import the information in pdf format.
  - **Patient’s insurance plan** - a useful feature is to integrate with the insurance providers and add patients’ plans.

  Now that we’ve covered patient app functionality, let’s proceed with the feature set that is most useful for doctors.



### Telemedicine App Features for Doctors

As for the telemedicine app for doctors, some of the functionality correlates with the patient app. On the other hand, there are some specific features that should be implemented only in this part of a telemedicine solution.

The key doctor app features are:

- **Doctor profile** - practitioners should fill out accurate information about their specialization, experience, education, and so on. It is possible that patients might like to check their license and proof of medical capabilities.
- **Scheduling and calendar** - the doctor should be able to set their availability, receive consultation requests, and manage a calendar filled with appointments.
- **Communication** - the patient-doctor interaction should be identical. In the first product version, it is better to utilize one-to-one messenger or consultation based on photos. If you have a larger budget, the best choice is to implement video conferencing for more detailed medical examinations. Note, this is a costly feature to develop.
- **EHR review** - doctors need to check a patient’s records either from their profiles, preliminary-filled questionnaires, hospital database, or by using other methods.
- **Medical prescription** - doctors should place their prescription digitally. Then, the patient is able to get the prescribed medication from a drugstore or required healthcare service. This way is also more efficient for patients with chronic diseases and ongoing prescriptions.

Other useful features that the telemedicine app for doctors could include:

- **Video or audio session recording** - ability to save or download the consultations. These files can be useful to track the treatment progress and for accurate referencing over time.
- **Dashboard and analytics** - doctors can have specific dashboards to make the necessary adjustments to their prescriptions and treatments.
- **Pharmacy databases** - the app can integrate with drug stores to provide patients and doctors with necessary medicine on time.

It is important to develop logical and hassle-free management of patient and doctor data via an admin panel.
